Nance: [wait=3]Hello there cowboy...[wait=1][speed=1.5] wasn't sure you would jack in.
- hello?
Nance: [speed=1.2]Didn't your mama tell you [i]"not to"[/i] stick other people's drives in your pc?[wait=1][next=auto]
Nance: [speed=1.1]Especially those you've met on the lone alleys.[wait=1][next=auto]
Nance: Why did you plug it anyway?

- who are you
	Nance: I'm Nance.[wait=1][next=auto]
	=>< RadiotextExplanation
- did you hack me
	Nance: Of course not [wait=0.5][i]silly[/i].[next=auto]
	Nance: Anyway,[wait=0.5] Im Nance.[wait=1] sorry for the barge in.
	- Its ok

	Nance: Im Nance.[wait=1][next=auto]
	Nance: The stick you jacked in had a radio-wave transmitter[wait=0.5], alongside this terminal software.[next=auto]
	Nance: Wasn't sure you would keep it tbh.[wait=0.5][next=auto]
	do Global.create_empty_lines(true)
	Nance: Anyway,[next=auto]
	Nance: It uses long range radio waves to deliver data. decentralized [wait=0.25]and encrypted E2E.[next=auto]
	Nance: Allows to talk without governments or corps spying on us.[next=auto]

Nance: You will probably have questions[wait=1.5], so ask away.

- why me
	Nance: My goal is to get as many as I can out of the net.[next=auto]
	Nance: Old web has been dead for a long time[wait=0.5] and [u][i]cypherpunk[/i][/u] battle is lost anyway.[wait=1][next=auto]
	Nance: Only [i]corp-aristos[/i] use it to rule people now.[next=auto]
	Nance: I build these sticks on my free time, usually hand them to strangers on the street[wait=1], like you.[next=auto]
	- you said us before
		Nance: I am not alone in this.[next=auto]
		Nance: We are a cyber-activist group. [wait=1]we call ourselves [b]Chirp Syndicate[/b][next=auto]
- why would they spy
	Nance: We are a [i]cyber-activist[/i] group. [wait=1]we call ourselves [b]Chirp Syndicate[/b][next=auto]

Nance: Basically I am the welcome party.
- do I join
	Nance: That part is totally up to you. [wait=1]no one can force you upstream.[next=auto]
	Nance: But you don't have to be all hasty about it.[wait=1] take your time, [wait=0.5]come back with your answer later.[next=auto]
	Nance: In the meantime get to know the terminal. there are weird people to talk in the wideband.[next=auto]
	Nance: I am signing off now, see you later.[wait=1] oh, also terminals show auto replies when we are away. don't be surprised by it.[do GameState.nance_lines_created += 20]

	Nance: Yeah[wait=0.7] the writer man.[wait=0.7] How did you find him?
	- he was interesting

			do GameState.nance_flirted += 1
			Nance: Why?[wait=0.7] you curious?
			- maybe
				Nance: We didn't date or anything if that's what you are after.
			- not at all
				Nance: And I sure do believe you.
	- boring
		Nance: Oh I can imagine, believe me.[wait=0.5] been there.[next=auto]
	- doesnt like syndicate
		Nance: So you talked about it.
		- a little
			Nance: I see.[next=auto]
			Nance: He doesn't like the way we operate.[wait=1] treats us like the invaders of this space.[next=auto]
			Nance: Not a fan of corps but isn't brave enough to get up from his chair and do something about it.[next=auto]
			Nance: I tried to convince him once. put so much effort into it but couldn't get him to join.[next=auto]
			Nance: I was a newcomer back then[wait=0.5]and Syndicate was fresh.
		- he asked how I got here
			Nance: And you said Nance... got it.[wait=0.7][next=auto]
			Nance: That probably pissed him off more :)[next=auto]
			Nance: He doesn't like it when I invite people over[wait=0.5]. wants to keep his old writing-radio all to himself.
	- doesnt like you
		Nance: What did I do to him?[wait=0.7] and how did I come up in the conversation?

	- no

- met chrome [if GameState.has_met_chrome == true]
	~ met_chrome
	Nance: That's a strong start.[wait=0.5] well done.[next=auto]
	Nance: He is a high praised ice-breaker.[wait=0.5] doesn't connect much[next=auto]
	Nance: You must have run into him in a good mood[wait=0.5]. which is not often, you are lucky.[next=auto]
	Nance: He was very skilled and useful in the rare occasions where he helped us.[next=auto]
	Nance: Mostly though, he is an asshole[wait=0.7] and a pain in the ass.[next=auto]
	- installed a plugin
