- How did u type yellow [if Global.active_color == green]
	Casey: It's rather easy actually. Just go into your computer/terminal interface settings.[wait=1] Never thought I would give someone tech advice in here.[next=auto]

	Casey: I was going to ask you, whether you liked it or not...[next=auto]
	Casey: But I guess that was a no.
	- Im sorry
		Casey: I accept your apology[wait=1], [i]mean[/i] stranger.[next=auto]
		Casey: Not everyone appreciates[wait=0.5] [i]art[/i][wait=0.5] first time they see it.[next=auto]
		Casey: My name is CASEY[wait=1] I'm a writer.[next=auto]
	- no it was good
		Casey: Oh[wait=2], wasn't expecting to be flattered after that mean enterance.[wait=1] Thank you.[next=auto]
		Casey: We started on the wrong foot. Allow me to introduce myself.[next=auto]
		=>< introduction 

- Who are you
	=>< introduction

- Hello
	=>< introduction

Casey: Forget all that now, what do you think about the greeting? Was it too descriptive, too mystique, perhaps a little hard to understand?
- Long sentences
	Casey: So what you are saying is, the reader loses the context at the end of the sentence, I see...[next=auto]
- Cool theme
	Casey: Well its pretty much what I got when I look out. They shat in the worlds eco-system and now we are the ones to suffer.[wait=1] I just romanticize it a little.[do casey_relation += 1][next=auto] 
- Too descriptive
	Casey: Then perhaps I should go easy on the vocabulary. It might get confusing within the whole sentence and futuristic lingo.[wait=1][next=auto]
	Casey: I mean I haven't yet added the lingo[wait=0.5], apart from the "rendered" part but sure it will get confusing when it is more complete.[next=auto]
- Unusual Perspective
	Casey: Right!? I was too intrigued when I noticed my flyscreen does that in real life. It was almost as if I was in a virtual world.[do casey_relation += 1][next=auto]
	Casey: Wait[wait=1], you are saying this as a good thing right?
	- Yes
		Casey: Thank god![next=auto]
	- No
		Casey: Oh. So what you mean is[wait=0.5], I should[wait=0.5] perhaps go with more usual descriptions. Got it.[next=auto]
	- Maybe
		Casey: All right then.[wait=1] Keep your secrets.[next=auto]

Casey: This passage is going to be the intro of my book[wait=1], so it's important that it's catchy.[next=auto]
Casey: Gotta hook the reader right into it.[next=auto]
Casey: I can show more of it.[wait=1] What I wrote I mean.[wait=1] If you'd like?[next=auto]

- Yeah sure
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
	Casey: Thank you.[wait=0.5] I promise they are not going to be boring. Also you will be amongst the lucky few which had a chance to read my stories.
	Casey: So consider yourself lucky.
- No thanks
	Casey: Oh[wait=2] sure.[wait=2] Okay.

	Casey: What do you think?
	- Awesome
		do casey_relation += 1
		Casey: Wow! You liked it that much huh.[if casey_relation >= 2] This is the second time you flatter me stranger. Not going to lie, I am beginning to like it.[/if] Thank you[wait=1] again.[wait=1] You are very kind.[next=auto]
	- Sounds familiar
		Casey: Does it?[wait=0.5] Well it's a modified version of an old movie. I've never encountered anyone that seen before,[wait=0.5] so... I thought why not use it.[next=auto]
	- can be better
		Casey: Thanks for the honest answer.[wait=0.3] I wrote it this morning actually. I wanted to get over with it in a short time since it's not a huge part of the book.[next=auto]
		Casey: But I'm glad. Because it really doesn't get better when people just fudge their opinion and say its good. While it is actually not.[next=auto]
	
	Casey: Anyway. I am mainly using Radiotext to talk about stories.[wait=1] And perhaps for the civil disobedience aspect of it.[next=auto]
	Casey: But enough with me, I haven't been kind enough to ask you anything till now. So stranger, why are you here?[next=auto]
	=> tell_me_about_yourself

- No thanks
	Casey: Oh[wait=2] sure.[wait=2] Okay.[next=auto]
	Casey: Well[wait=0.5] thats mainly why I am here.[wait=1] Talking about writing and[wait=0.5] a bit of a civil disobedience.[next=auto]

Casey: You tell me about yourself[if casey_prog == 2] then[/if].
- What do you mean
	Casey: I mean I am out of topics to chat about, you tell something.
	- No the civil thing
		Casey: Oh that[wait=1], the government doesn't allow people to broadcast on the radio[wait=1] or use its frequency or something I don't know.[next=auto]
		Casey: They tell that it interferes with the military communication or something. Also there was pirate radios before times so, it was a measure against that too.[next=auto]
		Casey: All complete bullshit if you ask me. I think they only fear that they can't control.
		Casey: They force us to use their channels to communicate.[speed=1.5] I don't obey to that law, I'm sorry.

		Casey: This cost him a lot.[wait=1] He had to give up an important part inside his head[wait=2], that carried his memories.[wait=1] Yet he did it anyway.[next=auto]
		Casey: He was working as a free agent. Carrying information from one client to another, secretly, within his head.[next=auto]
		Casey: Clients were usually corpos. Swimming in money[wait=1], still can't wait to make more.[next=auto]
		Casey: And the information was always encrypted. He wasn't allowed to peek at what he was carrying.[wait=1.5] Yet he did it anyway.[next=auto]
		Casey: He wanted to sell it to another buyer at the same time. He was doing this gig for so long already[wait=1] and even sacrificed half his head.[wait=1][next=auto]
		Casey: "Just this once" he was saying to himself "and then I'm out with the money" planning to buy his memories back.[next=auto]
		Casey: But there was competition. When the other corporates have learnt what he was carrying in his head, they didn't want to share it.[next=auto]
		Casey: They sent in the fixers. Wanting to have the info to themselves, they gave the order "flatline".[next=auto]
		Casey: Man survived some.[wait=1] Ran for too long. Then gave up at some point. Crying towards the fixers,[wait=1] "[shake]All I wanted was to remember my mom[/shake]".[next=auto]
